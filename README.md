GRO
---

GRO is a dynamic musical composition for web browsers. 

Five audio loops of differing lengths are stacked together to create an effect similar to [Phasing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_music) or [Euclidean Rhythm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_rhythm).

Initial parameters (such as the key and the tempo) change slightly with every page load, and the volume of each loop continuously fluctuates.

The result is a pleasant drone and a simple melodic phrase that subtly evolves over time. 

The piece should play on any recent device with any major web browser except IE. Chrome is recommended.
